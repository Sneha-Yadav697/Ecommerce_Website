# Ecommerce_Website
Its an Ecommerce_Website with Add-to-cart Functionality and Login Functionality.
* I added products details to json file and used it as an api.
* I showed the products on page by using html template tag. And Showed those product templates details by clone the object data.  
* I used browser local storage to store products data which were added to the cart.
* In local storage I stored id, Quantity and price of the products.
* I make an increment decrement features to increase decrease the quantity.
* AtLast, I made a total function which also changes,when we increase decrease the products of add to cart page.
So, these are the functionality I added to this website.
